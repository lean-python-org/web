For else
========

Example
-------

```python
for animal in animals:
    if animal == my_pet:
        break
else:
    print("No pet is found :-(")
```

Status
------

Deprecated Python

TLDR;
-----

Don't use - it confuses lots of programmers and there are much more readable alternatives using ```if else```.
